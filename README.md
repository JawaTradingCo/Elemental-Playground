# Elemental Playground

This project is more of a sandbox for me to test different programming techniques. It's target is to achieve a similar effect to that of "The Powder Toy" but with less computational resources. 
The game currently simulates basic density, temperature, fluid dynamics and electricity.

The toolbar at the bottom allows you to choose from a moderately large variety of elements and tools.
